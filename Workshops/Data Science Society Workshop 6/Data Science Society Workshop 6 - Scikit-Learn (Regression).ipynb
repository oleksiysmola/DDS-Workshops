Plotting the two arrays reveals a set of data that seems to show some kind of relationship between ````x```` and ````y````. The data here seems to change linearly as ````x```` changes. We can model this with a line of best fit for the data. The equation for a straight line is given by:\n",
    "$$y = mx + c $$\n",
    "Where $y$ is known as your label or dependant variable and $x$ is your feature or independant variable. The value $m$ is the gradient or the slope of the line, while $c$ is the $y$ intercept ie the point where the line crosses the $y$-axis. The algorithms we will use today from Sci-Kit Learn are designed to determine the values of $m$ and $c$ so that a line of best fit may be found."

    "#### Reshaping\n",
    "The first step as is to prepare the data. This step is known as preprocessing. The first thing that's necessary in this case is to reshape the data. This is because our data is currently in the form of an array that is just one long row when the functions from Sci-Kit Learn deal with columns. To fix this we can use ````np.reshape(x,(-1,1))````. Here we will use ````x.reshape(-1,1)```` which for a Numpy array ````x```` is equivalent to using the ````np.reshape```` function as described earlier. Here the $1$ specifys that the data will have one column and $-1$ allocates a value for this dimension based on how many dimensions are left. Since here we have $1$ column the data can only be shaped as one column. It is also worth noting that we typically use a capital ````X```` to denote our features or independent variables and again we use ````y```` for our dependent variable or label. Depending on how your data is formatted to begin with this step may not be required. If your ````X```` is a data frame with multiple columns for instance you will not need to convert it to an array. Anything with one column likely needs to be converted to an array and reshaped as demonstrated below."

    "When dealing with large datasets it may take a while to train your regressor (or classifier for a classification algorithm). In such cases its often useful to use pickling; in effect storing the results of the trained model so that it can be loaded in later. To do this we first have to create a new file by using ````open(\"filename\",\"wb\")````. This command tries to open a file with the specified ````\"filename\"````and if no such file is available one will be created. The ````\"wb\"```` argument specifies what we will do with the file. Here the ````w```` indicated we would like to write into the file. We also define our opened file as ````f```` but any suitable variable name is fine. To store the model in the file we write ````pickle.dump(regressor,f)```` where the first argument is the regressor to be stored and the second is the variable name chosen for our file. Once we are done with the file we write ````f.close()```` to close it."
