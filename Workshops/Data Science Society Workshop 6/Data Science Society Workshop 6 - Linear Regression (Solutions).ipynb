    "### Debugging Problem\n",
    "The dataset used in the problem below consists of two columns: one for years of experience and another for salaries. An attempt was made to apply a linear regression model to the data. Debug the code to fix the model. Note, since this is a small data set I've chosen test size to be $0.5$ so that there are enough test points to plot a best fit line encompassing most of the data. This may reduce the score of the model but the line plots shouldn't change too drastically as a result. The score should be consistently above $0.9$ when running the code multiple times."

    "The data set \"fish-market.zip\" contains data on the lengths, height and width of fish for various fish species. The function ````pd.read_csv```` can open csv files within zip files so just use the zip file name as the argument for this function. From this csv file create one data frame for each fish species where data for the other species has been removed. Then define a function which splits takes a data frame as the argument. The function should create a linear regression model for the input fish species data frame. For your independent variables use all of the columns other than \"Species\" and \"Weight\". Within the function print the score for the model then return the trained model as output for the function. Run the function once for each of your fish species data frames. Hint: What Pandas functions will help you identify and select specific species? Feel free to refer back to the last workshop if need be!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: given how small this data set is, expect the score to potentially vary wildly. This happens because often the ````train_test_split```` function might allocate the test data in a region outside the training data. Compare your result to the solutions when you are confident with your function."
