    "## Data Science Workshop 1: Fundamentals of Python\n",
    "Welcome to the first Data Science Society workshop on Python! The aim of these workshops will be to teach you enough Python so that you'll be able to use machine learning algorithms on various datasets for data analysis. We will be avoiding the more complex maths behind these algorithms leaning instead towards packages like Scikit Learn which already provide us with these algorithms. To begin with we will cover the very basics of Python. The workshop will mainly go over the Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Scikit Learn packages but there are many more in Python that will not be covered in the workshops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Throughout these workshops we will be using the Jupyter Notebook editor. In this editor code is run in code cells and text is run in markdown cells. You can change the type of cell using at the top of the page below the words Kernel and Widgets. The options to edit cells are found at the top of the page: \"+\" to create a new cell, scissors to cut a cell etc.\n",
    "#### Markdown Cells\n",
    "The text you are reading now is in a markdown cell. To edit the text double click on the cell. To run the cell press Shift + Enter. These cells don't actually run code but mainly serve as a means of allowing you to describe what your code is supposed to do, so that you can inform someone else or remind yourself of what your code is doing when you revisit it. These cells also allow for the formatting of equations when you place something in between two single dollar signs. For instance: $ E = mc^2 $. Doing so between two double dollar signs places the equation on a new line like so: $$ \\nabla \\cdot B = 0. $$ \n",
    "Don't worry about what these equations mean!\n",
    "#### Code Cells\n",
    "Code cells are as the name the suggests where you actually write you're code. You can run a code cell by pressing Shift + Enter to run the code in that cell. When you run a cell the output will be displayed below the code cell. Below is a code cell for you to run. "

    "### Commenting \n",
    "Inside code cells you can write notes by using the # symbol. Putting it in front of a line of code means that code won't be run when running the cell. This is useful when you want to see what removing a line of code briefly without deleting the line entirely and having to rewrite it again. Additionally, the # symbol is used in commenting on your code so that another user, or yourself when you return to the code can figure out what that code does. It is good practice to leave comments in your code however they should be consise to avoid overcommenting that may make your code harder to read. If ever in doubt imagine that if you ever undercomment two kittens die and if you ever overcomment one kitten dies. Below is a code cell identical to the one above save for the fact the # symbol is in front of the line of code. If you run the code you will not see any output."

Sometimes this involves writing something to the effect of ````2x```` instead of ````2*x```` where the former would look for a variable defined as ````2x```` and the latter would multiply a variable ````x```` by $2$. In large calculations when using brackets it is very easy to make mistakes so be alert for potential mistakes. Clarity of code is important to help make it easier to read and spot mistakes.

This may seem a trivial distinction but it can be important as some functions will only take integers as so if you pass float instead you'll recieve an error. Both floats and integers are real numbers but the integer lacks any decimal points. In addition to floats and integers there are also strings which are a collection of characters, often text but sometimes numbers.
